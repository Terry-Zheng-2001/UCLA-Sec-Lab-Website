Hi, this is Ying Li. I’m a 2nd-year Ph.D. Student in the ECE department at UCLA, working with Prof. Yuan Tian.

I am broadly interested in real-world computer security and privacy topics, including LLM for security, automated reasoning, etc.

I received my Bachelor’s degree from Sichuan University(SCU), and after that, I studied at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS). I was also a research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK).

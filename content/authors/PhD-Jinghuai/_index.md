I received my Master and Bachelar Degree in Computer Science from Duke University and City University of Hong Kong, respectively, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zhenqiang Gong Neil and Prof. Jianping Wang.

I am broadly interested in the machine learning, security, and privacy with a recent focus on the intersection between them.

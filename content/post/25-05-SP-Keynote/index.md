Prof. Tian will give a talk at 8th Deep Learning Security and Privacy Workshop.

Artificial-intelligence applications are no longer confined to discrete models running in isolation. With the advancement of GenAI, the AI applications are end-to-end systems that ingest live data, invoke complex toolchains, and operate inside intertwined virtual and physical environments. Yet most security guidance still targets individual components, leaving systemic blind spots that adversaries eagerly exploit. This talk focuses on AI system security beyond model-centric hardening. In particular, I will discuss two main points: secure the entire pipeline of AI supply chain, and secure AIâ€™s interactions with cyber and physical environments.

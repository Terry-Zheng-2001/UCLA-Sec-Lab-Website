abstract: The increasing prevalence of software vulnerabilities necessitates automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive overview of the AVR landscape, encompassing both synthetic and real-world vulnerabilities. Through a systematic literature review and quantitative benchmarking across diverse datasets, methods, and strategies, we establish a taxonomy of existing AVR methodologies, categorizing them into template-guided, search-based, constraint-based, and learning-driven approaches. We evaluate the strengths and limitations of these approaches, highlighting common challenges and practical implications. Our comprehensive analysis of existing AVR methods reveals a diverse landscape with no single ``best'' approach. Learning-based methods excel in specific scenarios but lack complete program understanding, and both learning and non-learning methods face challenges with complex vulnerabilities. Additionally, we identify emerging trends and propose future research directions to advance the field of AVR. This SoK serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, offering a structured understanding of the current state-of-the-art and guiding future research and development in this critical domain.

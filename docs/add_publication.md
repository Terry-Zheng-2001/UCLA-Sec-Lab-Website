# How to add a publication

If you are going to add a publication for our lab, please first create a new publication folder in [publications folder](https://github.com/UCLA-Security-and-Privacy-Lab/UCLA-Sec-Lab-Website/tree/main/content/publication).

Then within this folder, you should include 2 files (I use Ying's SoK paper as example):
- [cite.bib](https://github.com/UCLA-Security-and-Privacy-Lab/UCLA-Sec-Lab-Website/blob/main/content/publication/2025-SoK/cite.bib)
- [index.md](https://github.com/UCLA-Security-and-Privacy-Lab/UCLA-Sec-Lab-Website/blob/main/content/publication/2025-SoK/index.md)
